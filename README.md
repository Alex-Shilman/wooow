# WoooW: A Real Application
I've built a quick, simple Node.js application.
My application, wooow, follow the classic approach taken by online stores everywhere.
I created an online product catalog that customer can browse by category and page. I also created an administration area that include create, read, update and delete (CRUD) facilities for managing catalog and relative catalog's image gallery and I protected it that only logged-in customers can make changes on their insertion.
